# I·AM·Xhe — Genesis-Hardened Constitutional Release

**Version:** 1.0.0 (January 2026)  
**Author:** James Brian Chapman  
**License:** Dual License (NC-DCX-1.0 / Commercial)

---

## Overview

I·AM·Xhe is a production-ready, offline-first, identity-sovereign civilization substrate that functions as a kernel, execution environment, and network protocol.

- **Identity is inalienable:** soul-bound, deterministic, non-transferable.  
- **Authority is explicit:** all power delegated via revocable policy-keys.  
- **Memory replaces time:** ordered pulses instead of clocks.  
- **History is eternal:** append-only, hash-linked, replayable.  
- **AI are advisors, not rulers:** outputs are advisory, never authoritative.  
- **Law is executable:** deterministic, inspectable, and forkable.  
- **Reputation is earned:** non-transferable, non-financial, non-speculative.  

The system is browser-first but not bound to the browser, supporting offline-first workflows, local persistence via IndexedDB, and distributed storage via Helia/IPFS.

	•	02-identity.html — identity creation & management
	•	03-policy-keys.html — authority delegation
	•	04-ai-agents.html — advisory AI integration
	•	05-addressing-rails.html — canonical addressing
	•	06-storage-rendering.html — Helia/IPFS storage
